# NotesInNeed
A Devotional Note Taking App designed to help users to quickly locate notes in times of need through Tags/Categories set to each note.</br>
Users can assign multiple tags on their notes and quickly view the only notes they need in their time of need.</br>
</br>
Through my daily devotions, I gain wisdom, learn more about the heart of God and understand how God wants me to live in this world.</br>
However, these devotional notes can pile up since I do it everyday. I figured that a lot of other Christians may experience this difficultly too.</br>
So I decided to develop this app to help christians quickly locate the specific group of notes that they need during their time of need.</br>

Developed using React Native and Firebase.
