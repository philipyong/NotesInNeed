I really like this girl but I know that I'm not ready for a relationship yet because there's so much to learn about God and myself. As good as it seems right now, it is not wise to disrupt my growth with God with my desires now. I need to build my castle first before I can welcome a queen. I just need to be reminded that I want to love the next person the way that God loves me and be the best boyfriend and husband I can be to them and lead her to Jesus too. I want to make sure that I have Jesus in the center of my life and it takes time with all my opinions and defenses, but at the end of it, I'll be like Him.\nI think I've learnt enough of the worldly ways and I'm good at being a worldly human but I still have so much to learn spiritually and also in terms of wisdom to make the right decisions and keeping myself away from sin. We as young ppl always want to be the first to achieve this and that and we want to marry young asap but I need to get to know the heart of God and be able to be a reflection of His heart then I'm ready",
